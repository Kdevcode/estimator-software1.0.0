# estimator-software1.0.0
My first real project. The main goal is to create a nice GUI that has custom shaped buttons and when clicked on with the mouse, adds product serial numbers and prices of each to a running list that can then be sent as a report to an email. I certainly do not know enough yet (I am totally new to programming) to tackle this project but I am hoping by actually getting started on a project I really want to come to life that I will learn as I go along. If anyone is actually reading this please feel free to give some constructive criticism or help out or whatever it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading -Kdevcode
